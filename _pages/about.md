👨🏻‍💻 I'm an undergraduate student at the NYU Abu Dhabi.

🔬 My research interests are in Quantization, which also heavily relies on Neural Architecture Search.

📽️ I actively learn new things, make personal projects, and try to use my Youtube channel to help other learn aswell.

<!-- # Selected Experience -->

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience

Currently, I am working as a Deep Learning **Student Researcher** at NYU Abu Dhabi under Prof. Muhammad Shafique working on a Mixed-format **Quantization** Framework. Additionally, I have prior experience working as a **Full-Stack Web Developer** using Google Cloud Platform, Firebase, Django for the back-end and Godot for the front-end.

<!-- ## 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the **ICLR** Blogposts Track communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/). -->

I have experience contributing to [IntelOwl](https://github.com/intelowlproject/IntelOwl), an open-source OSINT solution to get threat intelligence data.

## 📚 Teaching and Community Contributions
I have programmatically made animations to aid in teaching math/CS concepts. I have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@ashirr9184) channel where I publish educational content. I also taught as a tutor at Schoolhouse.
