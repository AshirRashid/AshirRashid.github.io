<!-- 📽️ I actively learn, make personal projects, and iterate on prototypes to test my ideas. -->

<!-- # Selected Experience -->

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience

Currently, I am a Data Science Intern at [GamaLearn](https://gamalearn.com/), focused on designing, experimenting with, and deploying data-driven solutions tailored to business needs.

My prior work experience:
- **Deep Learning Researcher** at NYU Abu Dhabi's [eBrain lab](https://ebrain4everyone.com/) under the mentorship of Prof. Muhammad Shafique working on a mixed precision Quantization framework. I created end-to-end data pipelines to enable efficient experimentation and clear interpretation of results. I used this pipeline to optimize frameworks for Quantizing and Pruning machine learning models.
- **Full-Stack Web Developer** at [Gantom Lighting & Controls](https://www.gantom.com/) using FastAPI and Django for the back-end, Github Actions for CI/CD, Firestore and PostgreSQL for data storage, Google Cloud Platform and Docker for deployment, and React for Front-end. This role required me to collaborate with technical, design, and customer support teams.

## 📚 Teaching and Community Contributions
I made animations using Python to aid in teaching math/CS concepts. I have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@ashirr9184) channel where I publish educational content. I also taught as a tutor at Schoolhouse.


<!-- TODO

Add more netsec stuff
Add a call to action: view my latest project
Add personal projects about netsec and arp poisining, splunk, firewalls

future projects that will be useful for my website: nlp
projects that I am interested in too: ml-based ids systems & hate speech detection in roman urdu
update linkedin too and buy premium & then reach out to ppl

in general, I need more informaiton on financial systems, business & corporate law
