<!-- 📽️ I actively learn, make personal projects, and iterate on prototypes to test my ideas. -->

<!-- # Selected Experience -->

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience

Currently, I am working as a **Deep Learning Researcher** at NYU Abu Dhabi under Prof. Muhammad Shafique working on a mixed precision Quantization framework.

I have prior experience working as a **Full-Stack Web Developer** using FastAPI and Django for the back-end, Github Actions for CI/CD, Firestore and PostgreSQL for data storing, Google Cloud Platform and Docker for deployment, and React for Front-end.

## 🤖 Open Source
- I contributed to [Learn GDScript](https://github.com/Arena-Rosnav), a free and open-source app for beginners to learn programming with Godot's GDScript language.
- I contributed to [IntelOwl](https://github.com/intelowlproject/IntelOwl), an open-source OSINT solution to obtain threat intelligence data.
- I have worked with and extended [HAQ](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/haq), an open-source mixed precision quantization framework.

## 📚 Teaching and Community Contributions
I made animations using Python to aid in teaching math/CS concepts. I have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@ashirr9184) channel where I publish educational content. I also taught as a tutor at Schoolhouse.


<!-- TODO

Add more netsec stuff
Add a call to action: view my latest project
