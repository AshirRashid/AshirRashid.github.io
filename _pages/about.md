👨🏻‍💻 I'm an Undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at NYU Abu Dhabi.

🔬 My research interests are in Quantization and Neural Architecture Search.

📽️ I actively learn new things, make personal projects, and iterate on prototypes to test my ideas.

<!-- # Selected Experience -->

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience

Currently, I am working as a **Deep Learning Researcher** at NYU Abu Dhabi under Prof. Muhammad Shafique working on a mixed precision Quantization framework.

I have prior experience working as a **Full-Stack Web Developer** using Django for the back-end, Github Actions for CI/CD, Firestore and PostgreSQL for data storing, Google Cloud Platform and Docker for deployment, and React for Front-end.

<!-- ## 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the **ICLR** Blogposts Track communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/). -->

## 🤖 Open Source
- I contributed to [Learn GDScript](https://github.com/Arena-Rosnav), a free and open-source app for absolute beginners to learn to program with Godot's GDScript language.
- I contributed to [IntelOwl](https://github.com/intelowlproject/IntelOwl), an open-source OSINT solution to get threat intelligence data.
- I have worked with and extended [HAQ](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/haq), an open-source mixed precision quantization framework.

## 📚 Teaching and Community Contributions
I have programmatically made animations to aid in teaching math/CS concepts. I have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@ashirr9184) channel where I publish educational content. I also taught as a tutor at Schoolhouse.
