I am extremely passionate about learning. I taught as a Mathematics/Computer Science tutor at SchoolHouse. I noticed that the illustrations were difficult to create by manual tools, but followed a strict pattern. Programmatic animation tools like Manim address this exact use case.

I extended the existing Manim toolkit to add tools that would help me illustrate concepts I taught (complex numbers, and modular arithmetic). This made it significantly easier to generate animations in high resolution, which could easily be adapted to illustrate various concepts.

I used this engine to demonstrate the concept being an algorithm I design for a [dynamic lightning affect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJfylP2r8Pk) in video games.
