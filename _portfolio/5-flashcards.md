Using this application, students can use a convenient Notion database (in the form of a table). I developed an app to extract this information from the Notion databases using the Notion API, and store it locally. The app could then create flashcards out of this data, and students could use it to revise their vocabulary information effectively. This made mine and other students' vocabulary revision for the SAT much simpler and more effective.
