In 10th Grade, me and my fellow students used Notion to record vocabulary information for SAT revision. I developed an app to extract this information from the Notion databases using the Notion API, and store it locally. The app could then create flashcards out of this data, and students could use it to revise their vocabulary information effectively. This made mine and my fellow students' vocabulary revision for the SAT much simpler and more effective.
